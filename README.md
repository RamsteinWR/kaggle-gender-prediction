# Kaggle - ICDAR2013 - Gender Prediction from Handwriting

I competed in another Kaggle competition called [Gender Prediction from handwriting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/icdar2013-gender-prediction-from-handwriting). Goal of the competition was to detect gender of a writer based on a writing style. 

Error metric is [LogLoss](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/LogarithmicLoss).

## Models
For this competition I tried many different models, but didn't submit a result, because no model was better then benchmark.

I played with [Ramp](https://github.com/kvh/ramp), (please use my clone with Fixes for some things, for this code).
It is very nice to work with, model testing is much faster.

I also tried [Spearmint](https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint) for parameter optimization but got only numpy errors when I ran it.
